Steps on how I trained tesseract
1:Get training image
	-I made the training images greeysacle and also used my image_scale_up.py scrip the scale the images by x4
2:Compines them into a .tif file.
	- I used jTestBoxEditor for that.http://vietocr.sourceforge.net/
3: Run "tesseract --psm 3 --oem 3 NAMEME.font.exp0.tif NAMEME.font.exp0 makebox" to generate a box file.Replace NAMEME with any name you want.
	- I'm using --psm 3 becouse my training images are multi lined.
	- NOTE: tif and box file need to be the same name for next step
4: Now open the .tif file using jTestBoxEditor Box edit function.
5:Go tough all the boxes checking if the letter/numbers are correct and the box boundries are right.
6:Use jTestBoxEditor train fuction to generate a .traineddata file
	- makes sure the correct OCR is selected.jTestBoxEditor comes with is own OCR.
7:a .traineddata will be generated and now you just replace the old .traineddata in ur OCR with the new one.

NOTE:Prociding user_word will be a good idea in the future.
Gona take all item name and split them into individual words.
